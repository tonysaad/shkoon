                  Ameen, Thorben and Maher met by coincidence in Hamburg. They
                  come from different musical backgrounds and developed their
                  own signature mixing arabic scales and traditional folk songs
                  with classical harmonic structures – Oriental melodies partner
                  up with occidental electronics.

                  This fusion of different styles results in a kind of music
                  that takes you away, no matter where you are from. Sometimes
                  it´s deep, sometimes it´s mellow. It can make you dream and it
                  can make you weep. Dance and sing with joy or close your eyes
                  and feel what lies beneath.
